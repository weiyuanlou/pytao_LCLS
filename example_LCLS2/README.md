Obtain lcls-lattice from 'https://github.com/slaclab/lcls-lattice'

If on personal computer, you need to gain permission (from Shankar Murali as of Jan 2023 ) to clone the repository :

`git clone https://github.com/slaclab/lcls-lattice.git`

Then you need to set the $LCLS_LATTICE variable in your bash_rc.


If on SLAC SDF, you can use Chris Mayesâ€™s directory ( might not be the latest version ): 

`export LCLS_LATTICE=/u/ad/cmayes/nfs/GitHub/lcls-lattice/`

For details go to 'https://slaclab.github.io/lcls-live/getting-started.html'


A few examples here are borrowed and modified from:

https://github.com/slaclab/lcls-live/tree/master/docs/examples

The lcls-live repository (unlike lcls-lattice) is public.

You could gain more practice with the advanced examples there.
